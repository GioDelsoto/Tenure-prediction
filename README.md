# Employee Tenure Prediction

This project focuses on predicting employee tenure within a company using machine learning techniques. 

## Project Overview

In this project, the following steps were taken:

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - A dataset containing information about the company's employees was cleaned.
   - Checked for duplicates, outliers, null values, and values outside the acceptable range.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted a thorough analysis to understand data distributions, correlations, and patterns.

3. **Machine Learning Model Testing**:
   - Various machine learning models were tested to predict whether an employee stays with the company or not.

4. **K-means Clustering**:
   - Although K-means did not improve the final results, it was beneficial in identifying several clusters of dissatisfied employees who might be seeking different conditions.

## Conclusion

The insights gained from this project can assist in understanding employee retention and the factors influencing it, allowing the company to make informed decisions to improve job satisfaction.
